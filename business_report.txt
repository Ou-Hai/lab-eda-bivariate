2. Product Categories and Best-Seller Status

Key Findings

A crosstab analysis was conducted between product category and best-seller status, followed by a Chi-square test of independence.
	•	Across all categories, best-seller products represent a small proportion of total products (generally below 10%)
	•	Despite the low absolute proportion, best-seller prevalence varies significantly across categories
	•	The Chi-square test returned a p-value close to 0, leading to rejection of the null hypothesis of independence
	•	Cramér’s V ≈ 0.12, indicating a statistically significant but weak association

Business Interpretation
	•	Becoming a best-seller on Amazon UK is a rare outcome, not the norm
	•	Product category plays a meaningful role in shaping the likelihood of achieving best-seller status
	•	From a business perspective:
	•	Category choice influences competitive dynamics and visibility
	•	Sellers should account for category-level competition rather than relying solely on product-level features

3. Product Price Distribution Across Categories

Key Findings

After removing extreme price outliers using the IQR method, price distributions were analyzed across all categories.
	•	Categories with the highest median prices are primarily:
	•	Technology-intensive and durable goods (e.g., Laptops, Desktop PCs, 3D Printers)
	•	Everyday consumer goods and gift categories tend to have lower median prices
	•	Median price provides a more stable measure than average price, which is sensitive to extreme values

Business Interpretation
	•	Product categories differ substantially in their price ceilings
	•	High-median-price categories:
	•	Typically involve longer decision-making cycles
	•	Require stronger emphasis on specifications, brand reputation, and perceived value
	•	Low-price categories are more suitable for:
	•	Volume-driven strategies
	•	Promotions and price competitiveness

4. Average Product Prices by Category

Key Findings

When comparing average prices across categories:
	•	Categories with the highest average prices are not necessarily the most frequent or popular
	•	A small number of expensive products can significantly inflate the mean price

Business Interpretation
	•	Average price reflects potential revenue per unit, but can be misleading
	•	Median price better represents the typical customer experience
	•	Strategic pricing decisions should consider both metrics:
	•	Mean price for revenue potential
	•	Median price for market positioning

5. Customer Ratings Across Product Categories

Key Findings

An analysis of rating distributions revealed that:
	•	Median ratings across many categories cluster tightly between 4.2 and 4.4 stars
	•	Differences in median ratings across categories are relatively small
	•	Some categories show zero median ratings due to limited or missing reviews

Business Interpretation
	•	Amazon ratings exhibit a ceiling effect, with most products rated highly
	•	Rating differences alone may provide limited differentiation
	•	Review volume and qualitative feedback may be more impactful than marginal rating improvements

6. Relationship Between Product Price and Ratings

Key Findings

Correlation analysis between price and ratings showed:
	•	Pearson correlation ≈ -0.12
	•	Spearman correlation ≈ -0.13
	•	Scatter plots reveal no clear linear or monotonic relationship

Business Interpretation
	•	Higher-priced products do not systematically receive higher ratings
	•	Premium products may face higher customer expectations, leading to stricter evaluations
	•	Pricing strategy should not assume a direct link between higher prices and customer satisfaction

⸻

7. Overall Business Conclusions
	•	Best-seller status is rare and varies by product category
	•	Category selection plays a strategic role in competitiveness and visibility
	•	Pricing structures differ substantially across categories and must be category-specific
	•	Product price and customer ratings are weakly and negatively correlated
	•	Effective decision-making requires a holistic approach, integrating category dynamics, pricing strategy, and customer expectations

⸻

8. Strategic Implications
	•	Sellers should evaluate category attractiveness before launching products
	•	Pricing strategies must align with category norms rather than platform-wide averages
	•	Customer satisfaction strategies should prioritize value delivery and experience, not price alone
